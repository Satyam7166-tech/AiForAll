## Introduction

Many people in India, including the hearing, speech-impaired and those living in rural areas, face problems such as low pay and exploitative working conditions. These individuals may not be aware of their rights and may have difficulty interacting with lawyers or seeking legal assistance.
Our project, AiForALL, is a state-of-the-art chatbot that assists with labour law inquiries. Our aim is to address these issues on labor law by providing an accessible and user-friendly platform for these individuals to learn about their rights and take action against those who abuse them. The chatbot takes text as input and can provide outputs in multiple formats: text, voice, and sign language video.

## Our Mantra

We believe in a more just world where everyone can stand up to what is not right. And we believe this, at some level, can be achieved through having more knowledge of the law. It is not possible for everyone to understand the complex language of the law or to remember all the rights. However, Large Language Models can... At the same time, we wish to bring this understanding of the law to hearing or speech-impaired people... #You don't necessarily need to speak to speeak out...
## Features
